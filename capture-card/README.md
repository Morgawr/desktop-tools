# Capture Card

This is a script used to hook into the pulse audio sinks and sources to
re-direct the audio feed of a console connected to a USB-HDMI capture card, and
to fetch the video feed through mpv (in a gamescope container).

You need to edit the specific audio interfaces to match your specific setup, and
have the right tools installed (gamescope, mpv, pulseaudio).
